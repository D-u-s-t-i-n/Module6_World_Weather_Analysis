# Part 1 Question
57 cities had rainfall while 22 cities had snowfall.

# Observations
In Part 1, of the randomly generated 1500 latitude and longitude coordinates, 547 unique cities were found. 
In Part 3, I think there is small room for improvement - I could not figure out how to pass lists or dataframes to the gmap API, so  resorted to passing the hard coded 4 city values.
